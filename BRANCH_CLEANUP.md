The script will:

- Clean up local references
- Show you the final branch list

### Option 2: Via GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to https://github.com/WasanthaK/Digital-Approval-Impact-Calculator/branches
2. Find each branch listed above
3. Click the delete (trash can) icon next to each branch

### Option 3: Via Git Command Line (Manual)
```bash
# Delete remote branches
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-de758515-2233-410a-b2b2-b21c1b87e309
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-7662c785-67ac-4a17-a0f2-82f461a1fd9b

# Clean up local references
git fetch --prune
```
